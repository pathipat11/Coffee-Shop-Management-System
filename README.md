# Coffee-Shop-Management-System

## Project Overview
The Coffee Management System is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline the operations of coffee shops. This system addresses key issues related to sales management, order processing, and inventory tracking, providing a more efficient and user-friendly experience for coffee shop owners, staff, and customers.

## 1. Introduction and Problem Statement
In recent years, the coffee shop business has gained widespread popularity, with many investors entering the market. Consumers have shifted from instant coffee to preferring aesthetically designed coffee shops with a modern and comfortable atmosphere. This trend, coupled with competition from major international coffee chains, has led to increased demand for efficient coffee shop operations.

The Coffee Gold Plate shop faced several operational challenges due to the lack of a proper sales management system. Common issues included:
- Pricing errors
- Duplicate orders
- Order processing delays causing customer dissatisfaction
- Inaccurate stock estimation leading to supply shortages

To address these issues, we developed a Coffee Management System that enables accurate sales calculations, efficient order processing, and detailed reporting.
